# CoinCollector - CSharp tests

This project contains C# AltTester tests for a project using the New Input System.
The tested actions are: tap object, key down/ key up, press key, click object, scroll, begin/end touch and tap simulated with swipe.

## Before running the tests
‚ùó Starting with version 2.0.0, the AltTester Desktop must be running on your PC while the tests are running.
To run the tests, you must include the AltTester Unity SDK in the project. To do that, you can choose between the following ways:
1. Install the [AltTesterDesktop](https://alttester.com/app/uploads/AltTester/desktop/AltTesterDesktopPackageMac__v2.0.1.zip), then open it.
2. Add the AltTester Unity SDK submodule to the project
    - use ``git submodule update --init`` command to pull the git submodule;
    - make sure that the submodule added is on the master branch (you can use the following command ``git checkout master`` in the <i>Assets/AltTester-Unity-SDK</i> folder);
    - also, if you already have the project, you should make a ``git pull`` on the master branch, in order to ensure that you are using the latest version of AltTester.

3. Download AltTester Unity SDK and import it into Unity 
    - download the AltTester Unity SDK from the AltTester website (https://alttester.com/alttester/#pricing - you will be able to download a package that will contain a unity package) or using this link https://alttester.com/app/uploads/AltTester/sdks/AltTester.unitypackage;
    - import the package into the project (drag-n-drop the package in the Assets folder);
    - a pop-up will appear, select All and click on Import.

## Run the tests

You can open the project in the Unity Editor and run the tests from the AltTester Editor window.
